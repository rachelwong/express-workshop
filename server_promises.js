  Instead of this endpoint needing to know about reading and writing files, we
  can move the reading and writing to other functions (ideally, to another
  file). The other reason to do this is because we want to load posts in a
  couple places (the GET and the POST).
  Once `loadPosts` (which calls `fs.readFile`) has completed its work, it will
  return the posts wrapped in a Promise â€“ we can access the posts themselves via
  the Promise's `then` method.
  `.then(function (posts) { res.send(posts) })`
  Using arrow functions this can be made a bit cleaner...
  `.then((posts) => res.send(posts))`
  ...also, if there's only one parameter we can drop the parentheses...
  `.then(posts => res.send(posts))`
  ...actually, since we're declaring a function that is simply directly passing
  the argument it receives to another function, we can cut out the middleman:
  `.then(res.send)`
  Don't forget to add a `catch` to handle any errors (even in tutorial code and
  learning exercises, error handling will help you, the dev, to understand what
  is going on then things don't work.
