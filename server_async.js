  GET endpoint, using async/await and arrow functions

  endpoints to call.
  Being able to easily read your data – and by easier, I mean for you the dev –

  want to write out all that `fs` stuff every time.

/*
  POST endpoint, using async/await and arrow functions
  With async/await you can pause execution of your code while you 'await' the
  result of a long-running function call (like writing to a database or calling
  another server).
  This is a more modern style of JavaScript (this feature was introduced in
  ES2017 (AKA ECMAScript 8)) and is especially useful when wanting to run a
  bunch of functions in a sequence, which is what we need to here, i.e., we
  can't write the posts until we've read the old one and appended to them.
  There's some other fanciness going on here which is worth explaining.
  For `newPost`, I created a new object using the current time as the key, which
  you can do by using the square brackets like that, that means 'set the key to
  be the result of this function call'. The reason I did all this is because I
  want to use the `newPost` twice, once to save and once to return to the caller
  as a confirmation of what has been saved (another RESTful thing).
  This makes the next line – the data saving line – a little trickier though,
  because if I save `newPost` as is, I'll be saving an object (newPost) within
  an object (posts.json data), which is not what we want here. So instead, I
  created a new object and used the spread operator `...` to say 'use the
  contents of `posts` here, and use the contents of newPost beside it'.
  The spread operator is another super handy modern JS feature, introduced in
  ES2015.
  NOTE: To be clear, this example is not intended to be the solution that someone
  doing this tutorial was expected to write, it's an example of how I would
  write it in a production code base, for your reference.
  That's not to say that it's perfect, and other devs would write it
  differently, but there it is.
